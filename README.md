##This Verilog-based Digital Filter Design project was developed using VS Code for coding, Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis, with ChatGPT assistance for code correction and debugging.

Digital FIR Filter Design Using Verilog

Overview
This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and simulation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter using Verilog HDL. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing applications due to their inherent stability and linear phase characteristics. The design uses fixed coefficients to implement a basic low-pass FIR filter.

Objective
To design a digital FIR filter using Verilog

Simulate the filterâ€™s response to a known input

Observe output waveform and verify the correctness

Perform performance analysis in terms of timing and functionality

Filter Design Details
Type: FIR (Finite Impulse Response)

Order: 3 (can be customized)

Number of Taps: 4

Fixed Coefficients: e.g., {1, 2, 3, 4}

Operation: Convolution (Dot Product)

Basic FIR Equation:
y[n] = h0*x[n] + h1*x[n-1] + h2*x[n-2] + h3*x[n-3]
